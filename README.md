# Spyfall-Offline

Offline Spyfall multiplayer game for iOS

## How to play

Rules for the game are flexible, but one set can be found [here](https://www.spyfall.app/gamerules).

To start a new game, one player will enter the number of players in the picker then tap "Create Game". This will generate a QR code.
The player to their left will then tap "Join Game" and scan the first player's QR code. This will generate a new QR code on that player's device.
Continue having each player show their QR code to the player to their left until everyone has joined the game. Make sure no two players scan the same code.
Once a player has joined the game, they can tap "Role/Location" to see the location if they are not the spy, or they will see the word "Spy" if they are the spy.

The app does not currently come with a built-in timer or roles for locations. The list of locations cannot be modified at this time.
